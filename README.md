Launch the project by running the entry point file, then see the results in the output/ directory.
When restarted, remember to delete the contents in the output/ directory and drop the database first.
Once launched, the log shows each data with its resource file name.
For now, the `CustomerFlatFileItemReader` is only for restart a single file, not for multiple files.
